# ReservationDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

'npm install' in project root and ng serve should get you running (assuming you have node and npm installed, if not you will need to download them). I think node version 10, 12 and up works, running v13.12.0 as of this moment.

Does have some statefulness and responsive features with some form validation.
